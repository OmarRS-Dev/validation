Validation Project
Hello again!

In this project, I used new annotations from jakarta.validation.constraints
(such as @NotBlank, @Size, @AssertTrue, etc).

I learned how to validate and ensure data integrity in a Java Bean.

Technologies used:
Java 17
Spring Boot
HTML

Note: As you can see, I'm not an expert in front-end development because I want to specialize as a backend developer. So, I didn't focus much on aesthetics.
